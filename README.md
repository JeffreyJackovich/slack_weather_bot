## 1. Introduction:  

###  Chatbot

A chatbot is a conversational agent that interacts with users in a certain domain or on a 
certain topic with natural language senences.  Normally, a chatbot works by a user asking a
question or making a comment, with the chatbot answering the question, or making a comment
or initiating a new topic.  

## Methodology: 
I used RasaHQ's Machine Learning based dialogue engine for conversational software, and 
connected Slack bot with a weather API to provide weather information.

## Future Work:
Incorporate an enterprise chatbot engine into an iOS application.
