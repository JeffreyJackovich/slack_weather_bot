## 1. Introduction:  

### 1.1 Chatbot

A chatbot is a conversational agent that interacts with users in a certain domain or on a 
certain topic with natural language senences.  Normally, a chatbot works by a user asking a
question or making a comment, with the chatbot answering the question, or making a comment
or initiating a new topic.  


### 1.2 Rasa
Rasa is an open source machine learning toolkit for developers to expand bots beyond 
answering simple questions.  Rasa contains two library's: rasa_nlu and rasa_core [2] [3].  The former
turns natural language into structured data, and the latter is a machine learning engine
for conversational software.  


##  2. Methodology: 
I used RasaHQ's Machine Learning (ML) and natural language processing library's to connect Slack 
with a weather API to provide weather information.


## 3. Future Work:
Incorporate an enterprise chatbot engine (<a href="https://dialogflow.com">Dialogflow</a>) into an iOS application.
